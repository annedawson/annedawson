Hi, 
I’m interested in building Android apps using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
I’m currently completing the Android Developers Course: Android Basics with Compose,
and will continue on to the intermediate and advanced courses.
I’m looking to collaborate on Jetpack Compose projects with senior programmers (by age),
particularly women programmers from the Fortran and Algol era.
